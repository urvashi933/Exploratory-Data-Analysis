# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It is an essential step in the data science workflow that helps researchers and analysts gain insights into their data, identify trends, and formulate hypotheses before applying more sophisticated statistical techniques.This EDA focuses on the CardioGoodFitness.csv dataset, utilizing R scripts for data cleaning and summary statistics. Visualizations are created in Power BI to explore distributions, relationships, and trends, aiding in understanding the data and formulating hypotheses for further analysis.

# Objectives of EDA
The primary objectives of EDA include:

 1. Understanding the Data Structure:
Identify the types of data (numerical, categorical, ordinal).
Understand the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns).

 2. Detecting Missing Values:
Identify columns with missing data and determine their impact on analysis.

 3. Identifying Outliers:
Detect anomalies that may skew results and need further investigation.

 4. Exploring Relationships:
Investigate relationships between variables using correlation and visualization techniques.

 5. Formulating Hypotheses:
Generate hypotheses based on observed patterns that can be tested in subsequent analyses.


# EDA Techniques
EDA employs various techniques, including:

 1.Descriptive Statistics:
Calculate measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quantiles to summarize the data.

 2.Data Visualization:
Use visualizations to represent data intuitively:
Histograms:To analyze the distribution of numerical variables.
Box Plots: To identify outliers and visualize the spread of data.
Scatter Plots: To explore relationships between two numerical variables.
Bar Charts: To compare categorical variables.
Heatmaps: To visualize correlations between variables.

 3.Data Cleaning:
Identify and handle missing values, duplicates, and erroneous entries.

 4.Feature Engineering:
Create new features that may provide additional insights or improve model performance.

 5.Tools and Libraries
Common tools and libraries used for EDA include:

 R Libraries:

dplyr: For data manipulation.
ggplot2: For data visualization.
tidyr: For data tidying.

# Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis is a foundational step in any data analysis project. It provides valuable insights into the data, helping to inform subsequent analyses and modeling efforts. By employing various techniques and visualization methods, analysts can uncover hidden patterns and make data-driven decisions.
